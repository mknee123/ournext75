            <p>A regionwide initiative on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Pittsburgh Renaissance to rededicate today’s and tomorrow’s leaders to the “Pittsburgh Values” of citizen leadership, commitment to community, and collaboration toward the next generation of regional transformation.

        <h2>Why now?</h2>
            <p>2019 represents the 75th anniversary of a unique moment in the history of the Pittsburgh region and the nation, a time during World War II when public and private sector leaders put down their differences and came together to make a better place.</p>
            <p>Led by financier R.K. Mellon and Mayor David L. Lawrence of the City of Pittsburgh, these leaders identified the post war challenges Pittsburgh had to overcome – smoky skies, polluted rivers, and a decaying urban environment – and made no small plans. They worked together to make them as reality. Over the course of a generation, the smoke cleared, the rivers ran cleaner, and the region became known as among the most livable in America.</p>
            <p>The Pittsburgh Values they adopted – citizen leadership, commitment to community, and public-private partnership – have guided more diverse leaders through bad times and good, from the collapse of the region’s industrial base in the 1980s to its emergence in the 21st century as a global leader in innovation in the digital and life sciences.</p>
            <p>Today, our region stands on the eve of a new decade and the next generation of transformation, the beginning of <em>Our Next 75</em>.</p>
